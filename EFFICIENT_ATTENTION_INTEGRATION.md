# Efficient Attention Integration Summary

## Overview

I have successfully integrated the efficient attention mechanisms from `efficient_transformer.py` into the main `models.py` file, making the `TimeSeriesTransformer` class a drop-in replacement that supports various attention types.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `TransformerBlock` class in `models.py`

- Added support for configurable attention types via `attention_type` parameter
- Added fallback mechanism for when efficient attention modules are not available
- Supports attention types: `"standard"`, `"local"`, `"sparse"`, `"featurewise"`, `"chunked"`, `"flash"`

```python
class TransformerBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(
        self, 
        num_heads: int, 
        d_model: int, 
        d_ff: int, 
        dropout_rate: float,
        attention_type: Literal[
            "standard", "local", "sparse", "featurewise", "chunked", "flash"
        ] = "standard",
        **attention_kwargs,
    ):
```

### 2. Enhanced `TimeSeriesTransformer` class

- Added `n_layers`, `attention_type`, and `attention_kwargs` parameters
- Updated transformer block creation to use efficient attention
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

```python
class TimeSeriesTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(
        self,
        config: TimeSeriesConfig,
        d_model: int = 64,
        n_heads: int = 4,
        n_layers: int = 4,
        attention_type: Literal[
            "standard", "local", "sparse", "featurewise", "chunked", "flash"
        ] = "standard",
        attention_kwargs: Optional[dict] = None,
    ):
```

### 3. Updated `TimeSeriesDecoder` class

- Added the same efficient attention parameters
- Passes attention configuration to the underlying `TimeSeriesTransformer`

### 4. Added `MaskedTabularPretrainer` class

- Complete PyTorch Lightning module for masked pre-training
- Supports all efficient attention mechanisms
- Includes proper loss functions for both numeric and categorical masked modeling

### 5. Updated `TabularDecoder` in `training/training.py`

- Added efficient attention parameters to maintain API consistency
- Passes through attention configuration to `TimeSeriesDecoder`

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Backward Compatible)
```python
# This still works exactly as before
transformer = TimeSeriesTransformer(config, d_model=64, n_heads=4)
```

### With Efficient Attention
```python
# Use flash attention for longer sequences
transformer = TimeSeriesTransformer(
    config, 
    d_model=64, 
    n_heads=4,
    attention_type="flash"
)

# Use local attention with custom window size
transformer = TimeSeriesTransformer(
    config, 
    d_model=64, 
    n_heads=4,
    attention_type="local",
    attention_kwargs={"window_size": 512}
)
```

### Pre-training with Efficient Attention
```python
pretrainer = MaskedTabularPretrainer(
    config=config,
    d_model=128,
    n_heads=8,
    attention_type="flash",
    learning_rate=1e-4,
)
```

### TabularDecoder with Efficient Attention
```python
decoder = hp.TabularDecoder(
    time_series_config, 
    d_model=512, 
    n_heads=32,
    attention_type="flash"
)
```

## Benefits

1. **Drop-in Replacement**: Existing code continues to work without modification
2. **Efficient Long Sequences**: Flash attention and other mechanisms can handle longer context windows
3. **Configurable**: Easy to switch between different attention mechanisms
4. **Robust**: Graceful fallback to standard attention if efficient modules aren't available
5. **Complete Integration**: All classes in the pipeline support efficient attention

## Testing

Created and ran `test_integration.py` which verified:
- ✓ All classes can be instantiated with efficient attention
- ✓ Forward passes work correctly with both standard and flash attention
- ✓ Backward compatibility is maintained
- ✓ Error handling works properly

## Files Modified

1. `/home/ubuntu/Hephaestus/hephaestus/timeseries_models/models.py` - Main integration
2. `/home/ubuntu/Hephaestus/hephaestus/training/training.py` - TabularDecoder updates
3. `/home/ubuntu/Hephaestus/pretrain_only_efficient.py` - Updated imports
4. `/home/ubuntu/Hephaestus/planets.py` - Example usage with flash attention

## Next Steps

You can now safely delete `efficient_transformer.py` as all its functionality has been integrated into the main `models.py` file. The integration provides:

- Better maintainability (single source of truth)
- Easier testing and debugging
- Consistent API across all models
- Future-proof design for adding new attention mechanisms

All existing code will continue to work, and you can gradually migrate to using efficient attention where needed for longer sequences or better performance.
